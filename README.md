Built in Unreal Engine 5.5.2

This is a mini game I'm working on. It's still a bit rough around the edges (especially the UI stuff) but the basic idea is there.
The goal is to train your ear and recreate played sound a short while after hearing it.

Use SetPuzzleHelper Enabled console command for help.

Built in Unreal Engine 5.5.2

This is a mini game I'm working on. It's still a bit rough around the edges (especially the UI stuff) but the basic idea is there.
The goal is to train your ear and recreate played sound a short while after hearing it.

The project was created as a technical showcase rather than a content-heavy game,
with emphasis on scalability, modularity, and production-oriented Unreal Engine practices.

## Project Goals

- Design gameplay systems in Unreal Engine 5
- Build modular, reusable C++ architecture with extensive subsystem usage
- Integrate audio as a gameplay-driven system
- Practice clean separation of responsibilities using UE patterns

## What is already there

- Overall C++ architecture
- Core gameplay systems (puzzles, interaction, items)
- Basic UI placeholder
